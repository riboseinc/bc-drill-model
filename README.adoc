* has an ordered list of *DrillSteps*.
* has a description of what to record in the drill report.
* belongs to a *BusinessActivity*.

DrillStep::
* is a *Step* that contains a timeframe within which it is expected to complete.

Step::
* has a textual description of the procedure involved in the relevant context.

Requirement::
* has a textual description of the resource needed.

Result::
* has a textual description of the drill step result.
* can be one of *Success*, *Failure*, *Skipped* or *Undetermined*.

Success::
* is a *Result*.
* indicates a successful drill step.

Failure::
* is a *Result*.
* indicates a failed drill step.

Skipped::
* is a *Result*.

Participant::
* represents a person involved in the drill.

DrillStepResult::
* represents the detailed result for the *DrillStep* it corresponds with.
* has one or more responsible persons and participants.
* belongs to a *DrillReport*.
* Labels can be assigned as to the `drillType` of this *DrillStep*.
* `startTime` and `endTime` are optional.
* `duration()` is to be calculated from `endTime` and `startTime`.

DrillReport::
* has the detailed result of the drill, in the form of an ordered list of *DrillStepResults*.
* belongs to a *DrillPlan*, via `planVersion`.
* has one or more `authors`.
* has a description of `followUpAction`.
* has a `startTime()` determined from the `startTime` attribute of the first item in its `stepResults` list.
